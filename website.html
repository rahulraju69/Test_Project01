        <p>A great content marketing strategy requires keeping your eyes on the road, maintaining the right speed, and finding ways around the inevitable roadblocks that will obstruct your path. When it comes to the state of content marketing in the auto industry, however, some major car brands are running on fumes.

            While creating our Top 50 content marketing brands of 2018, NewsCred discovered somewhat of a void in the automotive space, with only three car brands (Land Rover, Mazda, and Zipcar) making the list. In other words, there’s a huge opportunity for carmakers to capture the hearts and minds of car buyers, driving enthusiasts, and those loyal to their brand. Although many car manufacturers have at least test-driven content marketing, only a few are keeping pace with other industries.

            For instance, most car brands prefer to focus on one-off campaigns rather than build up robust content libraries or hubs. And in cases where non-product, storytelling content does exist, the brands don’t always do a good job getting it to its destination through the proper distribution channels.</p>

        <p>Our society tends to place an emphasis on romantic relationships. We think that just finding that right person will make us happy and fulfilled. But research shows that friends are actually even more important to our psychological welfare. Friends bring more happiness into our lives than virtually anything else.

            Friendships have a huge impact on your mental health and happiness. Good friends relieve stress, provide comfort and joy, and prevent loneliness and isolation. Developing close friendships can also have a powerful impact on your physical health. Lack of social connection may pose as much of a risk as smoking, drinking too much, or leading a sedentary lifestyle. Friends are even tied to longevity. One Swedish study found that, along with physical activity, maintaining a rich network of friends can add significant years to your life.

            But close friendships don’t just happen. Many of us struggle to meet people and develop quality connections. Whatever your age or circumstances, though, it’s never too late to make new friends, reconnect with old ones, and greatly improve your social life, emotional health, and overall well-being.</p>

        <p>Street food is ready-to-eat food or drink sold by a hawker, or vendor, in a street or other public place, such as at a market or fair. It is often sold from a portable food booth,[1] food cart, or food truck and meant for immediate consumption. Some street foods are regional, but many have spread beyond their region of origin. Most street foods are classed as both finger food and fast food, and are cheaper on average than restaurant meals. The types of street food varies between regions and cultures in different countries around the world.[2] According to a 2007 study from the Food and Agriculture Organization, 2.5 billion people eat street food every day.[3] A majority of low-and-middle-income consumers[4] rely on the quick access and cheap service of street food for daily nutrition and job opportunities, especially in developing countries.</p>
